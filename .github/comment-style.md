# Function Comment Style Guide

All comments for functions should only indicate what the function does, not state that it is a function or a helper/utility.

**Example:**
- Good: `// Converts a guess (set of 4 words) to a 16-bit number`
- Good: `// Checks if a guess (as sorted string key) exists in guessNumbers`
- Bad: `// Helper function to convert a guess (set of 4 words) to a 16-bit number`
- Bad: `// Utility to check if a guess exists in guessNumbers`

Comments should describe the purpose or effect of the function, not its role in the codebase.

Apply this style to all function comments throughout the codebase.
