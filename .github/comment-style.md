# Function Comment Style Guide

All comments for functions should only indicate what the function does, not state that it is a function.

**Example:**
- Good: `// Converts a guess (set of 4 words) to a 16-bit number`
- Bad: `// Helper function to convert a guess (set of 4 words) to a 16-bit number`

Apply this style to all function comments throughout the codebase.
