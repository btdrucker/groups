# Redux Conversion Summary

This document summarizes the complete conversion of the project to use Redux for state management.

## New Files Created

### 1. `/src/features/auth/slice.ts`
- **Purpose**: Manages authentication state
- **State**: user, loading, error, authMode, initialized
- **Actions**: 
  - `signInWithGoogleThunk` - Sign in with Google
  - `signInWithEmailThunk` - Sign in with email/password
  - `signUpWithEmailThunk` - Create new account
  - `signOutThunk` - Sign out user
  - `resetPasswordThunk` - Send password reset email
  - `setUser` - Set authenticated user
  - `setAuthMode` - Change between login/signup/reset modes
  - `clearError` - Clear authentication errors
- **Selectors**: selectUser, selectAuthLoading, selectAuthError, selectAuthMode, selectAuthInitialized

### 2. `/src/features/puzzles/slice.ts`
- **Purpose**: Manages puzzle CRUD operations
- **State**: puzzles, loading, error, selectedPuzzle
- **Actions**:
  - `fetchUserPuzzles` - Load user's puzzles from Firestore
  - `createPuzzleThunk` - Create a new puzzle
  - `updatePuzzleThunk` - Update existing puzzle
  - `selectPuzzle` - Select a puzzle for editing
  - `clearSelectedPuzzle` - Clear selected puzzle
  - `clearError` - Clear puzzle errors
- **Selectors**: selectPuzzles, selectPuzzlesLoading, selectPuzzlesError, selectSelectedPuzzle

### 3. `/src/features/app/slice.ts`
- **Purpose**: Manages app-wide UI state
- **State**: currentView (list or composer)
- **Actions**:
  - `setCurrentView` - Set the current view
  - `navigateToList` - Navigate to puzzle list
  - `navigateToComposer` - Navigate to puzzle composer
- **Selectors**: selectCurrentView

## Updated Files

### 1. `/src/app/store.ts`
- Added auth, puzzles, and app reducers to the store
- Configured redux-persist to only persist composer state
- Added middleware configuration to ignore serialization checks for Firebase User objects

### 2. `/src/app/App.tsx`
- Removed local state management (user, loading, currentView, reloadKey, selectedPuzzle)
- Now uses Redux hooks (useAppDispatch, useAppSelector)
- Subscribes to auth state changes and dispatches setUser action
- Simplified component - no longer passes props down to children

### 3. `/src/features/composer/Composer.tsx`
- Removed Props interface (no longer receives props)
- Now gets user and selected puzzle from Redux
- Dispatches createPuzzleThunk/updatePuzzleThunk for saving
- Dispatches navigateToList for navigation
- Still uses local state for form inputs (puzzle being edited)

### 4. `/src/features/puzzles/PuzzleList.tsx`
- Removed Props interface (no longer receives props)
- Now gets user and puzzles from Redux
- Dispatches fetchUserPuzzles on mount
- Dispatches selectPuzzle and navigateToComposer when selecting a puzzle
- Dispatches clearSelectedPuzzle and navigateToComposer when creating new puzzle

### 5. `/src/features/auth/AuthScreen.tsx`
- Removed local state for authMode
- Now uses selectAuthMode selector from Redux
- Simplified component

### 6. `/src/features/auth/LoginForm.tsx`
- Removed Props interface
- Removed local state for error and loading
- Now uses Redux hooks for auth actions
- Dispatches signInWithGoogleThunk and signInWithEmailThunk
- Dispatches setAuthMode to change auth screens
- Still uses local state for form inputs (email, password)

### 7. `/src/features/auth/SignupForm.tsx`
- Removed Props interface
- Removed local state for error and loading
- Now uses Redux hooks for auth actions
- Dispatches signUpWithEmailThunk
- Dispatches setAuthMode to change auth screens
- Still uses local state for form inputs (email, password, confirm)

### 8. `/src/features/auth/ResetPasswordForm.tsx`
- Removed Props interface
- Removed local state for error and loading
- Now uses Redux hooks for auth actions
- Dispatches resetPasswordThunk
- Dispatches setAuthMode to change auth screens
- Still uses local state for form inputs (email) and success state

### 9. `/src/features/auth/WelcomeUser.tsx`
- Removed local state for error and loading
- Now uses Redux hooks for sign out
- Dispatches signOutThunk
- Gets loading and error state from Redux

## State Architecture

## Benefits of Redux Conversion

1. **Centralized State**: All application state is now in one predictable location
2. **Better Testing**: Redux slices can be tested independently
3. **DevTools**: Redux DevTools provide time-travel debugging
4. **Predictable Data Flow**: Actions → Reducers → State → UI
5. **No Prop Drilling**: Components access state directly via hooks
6. **Persistence**: Redux-persist handles state persistence automatically
7. **Async Handling**: Redux Toolkit's createAsyncThunk simplifies async operations
8. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with typed selectors and actions

## Key Patterns Used

- **Redux Toolkit**: Modern Redux with less boilerplate
- **Async Thunks**: For handling Firebase operations
- **Typed Hooks**: useAppDispatch and useAppSelector for type safety
- **Selector Pattern**: Centralized state access via selector functions
- **Redux Persist**: Automatic state persistence to localStorage
- **Middleware**: Custom configuration for Firebase User serialization

## Migration Notes

- Local form state remains local (email, password inputs) - this is intentional and follows best practices
- Firebase auth listener remains in App.tsx as it needs to dispatch to Redux
- Redux-persist only persists composer state to avoid stale auth/puzzle data
- All async operations now go through Redux thunks for consistency
